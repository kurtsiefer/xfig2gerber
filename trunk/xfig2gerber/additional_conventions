conventions to handle documentation layers and stencil generation in a
consistent way:

layer 4 (red or magenta) is used for component indices
layer 7 (red) is used for side ruler 
layer 21 is component pads which go to solder mask, and stencil mask
layer 22 are solder pads that do not contribute to component identification
but go to the stencil mask
layer 23 contribute not to stencil mask but to solder mask layer
