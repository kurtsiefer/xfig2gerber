#summary Two examples of converted figure files

= Two-layer example =
The original xfig file (`pd_new.fig`) represents a simple photodiode holder with a battery connection and a BNC connector. The original can be found in the subversion repository in the `svn/examples/2layer` tree.

The manufacturing files were created with the command
{{{
xfig2gerber -D -o photodiode pd_new.fig
}}}

The image below shows the output of the gerbv program when invoked with 
{{{
gerbv photodiode*`
}}}
The light green circles represen the `holes.drl` file content, the light purple the `*.compsilk.lgx` top solder mask openings, and the dark purple lines connextions on the top side.

= Four layer board = 
A more complex example is found in the ``svn/examples/4layer` tree. The original xfig file (`miniusb.fig`) represents a four-layer board of a EZ-USB adapter with a few external components. All Gerber files can be found in the example directory as well; visit it via the browse tab in this wiki.

The manufacturing files were created with 
{{{
xfig2gerber -F -X -i -o usbasapt miniusb.fig
}}}

We show four images, again obtained with gerbview:

First, the top side; shown are the hole layers (orange), the silk screen (light green), the solder mask (purple) and the top copper layer (turquoise):

Then, the bottom side with copper (brown), soldermask (purple) and holes (orange):

The topside inner layer is connected to ground. Note the large free openings for some vias due to the `-i` option. Besides the copper layer, the holes (orange) are shown for orientation:

The bottomside inner layer is connected to +3.3V. Besides the copper layer, the holes (orange) are shown for orientation:

There is also a stencil mask generated with the command
{{{
xfig2gerber -r 2 -n 20 -o u miniusb.fig
}}}
This is a trick to only extract the xfig layer 20, circumventing the knockout layer mechanism. The `gerbv` look at it reveals a pattern suitable for solder paste stencil generation:
